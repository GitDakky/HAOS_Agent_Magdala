## Guardian Scenarios

### ðŸŒ… Morning Briefing
*"Good morning, David. I've noticed you're up 30 minutes early today. I've started the coffee maker and adjusted the thermostat to 72Â°F. Your first meeting is at 9 AM, and traffic is light on your usual route."*

### ðŸš¨ Security Alert
*"David, I've detected motion in the backyard at 2:15 AM. The security camera shows a raccoon near the garbage cans. I've logged this event and increased exterior lighting for the next hour."*

### ðŸ’Š Wellness Check
*"It's 8 PM and time for your evening medication. I've also noticed the air quality has dropped due to wildfire smoke. I've activated the air purifier in the bedroom."*

### âš¡ Energy Optimization
*"I've noticed the washing machine has been running during peak energy hours. I can schedule it to run at 11 PM when rates are 40% lower. Would you like me to set this up automatically?"*
