## üöÄ **Getting Started**

The foundation is solid with v0.7.0. The next immediate priorities are:

1. **Test the chat interface** - Get user feedback
2. **Implement anomaly detection** - Start with energy monitoring
3. **Build automation suggestions** - Begin with simple pattern recognition
4. **Add voice integration** - Connect with HA Assist

**This roadmap transforms Agent Magdala into the most advanced Home Assistant copilot available, combining proactive intelligence, natural language interaction, and comprehensive home management capabilities.**
